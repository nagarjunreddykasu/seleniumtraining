List interface:
1. Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Add 5 string objects into one ArrayList
b. Insert one string object at 2nd position //add(obj)	add(1,"")
c. Delete the value at 3rd index //remove(3)
d. Update the value at 3rd position with 1st index value //get(1)
e. Display the value of 4th position in console
f. Display the count of objects available in ArrayList.

2. Write a program to add objects of two ArrayLists into another ArrayList.

3. Write a program to store the list of objects from 1st index to 4th index from one ArrayList to another ArrayList

4. Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Delete all the objects from first ArrayList that are contained in second ArrayList
b. Delete all the objects from first ArrayList that are NOT contained in second ArrayList

5. Write a program to add 6 string objects into ArrayList and display all the data in console using for, for each, Iterator and ListIterator.

6. Write a program to add 3 string objects into Vector and display all the data in console using all possible ways.

7. Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Add 4 string objects (ex: element1, element10, element3, element4) into one ArrayList
b. Add one more string object(ex: element5) in above ArrayList using ListIterator
c. Update the value "element10" with "element2" using ListIterator
d. Delete the value at last position using ListIterator

8. Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Add 7 string objects into one ArrayList
b. Display all the objects in ascending order
c. Display all the objects in descending order using 2 possible ways.

9. Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Create one string array with 3 values and convert this array as ArrayList and then print the values from ArrayList individually.
b. Add 4 string objects into one ArrayList and Convert this ArrayList as Array and then print the values from Array individually.

10. Write a program to add first 10 integers in ArrayList using for loop and Delete all the integers except even numbers from the ArrayList and then print the ArrayList having even numbers in console.

11. Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Add 4 string objects into one LinkedList
b. Add one object at first position and last position
c. Delete the object at 3rd position
d. Update the value at 4th position with 2nd index value

12. Write a program to add all String objects from one ArrayList to other LinkedList without using addAll() and then print the objects of LinkedList in console.
