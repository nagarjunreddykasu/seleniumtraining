Map Interface:
1.	Write a program to Add 7 entries of type String into HashMap and then print all the keys in 3 possible ways.

2.	Write a program to Add 7 entries of type String into HashMap and then print all the values in 3 possible ways.

3.	Write a program to add all objects from one HashMap to other HashMap using 2 possible ways and then print all the keys & values of second HashMap in console using Iterator.

4.	Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Create a class (ex: Search) and define two instance variables of type int & String respectively and initialize the values using constructor
b. Create another class (ex: HashMapDemo) and add two entries of type String & Search (i.e., String key and Search object as value) and print all the keys & values of HashMap using Iterator and for each.

5.	Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Create a class (ex: Search) and define two instance methods
b. Create another class (ex: HashMapDemo) and add one entry of type String & Search (i.e., String key and Search object as value) and get the value based on key and then call the methods using returned object reference.

6.	Write a program to Add 5 entries of type String into LinkedHashMap and then print all the keys & values using for each and Iterator.

7.	Write a program to Add 5 entries of type String into TreeMap and then print all the keys & values using Iterator and for each.

8.	Write a program for the following scenarios:
a. Add 5 entries of type String into TreeMap and delete the entry if the specified key is present in the TreeMap
b. delete the entry if the specified value is present in the TreeMap

9.	Write a program to get the data from properties file.

10.	Write a program to Add 5 entries of type String into Hashtable and then print all the keys & values using Iterator, Enumeration and for each.
