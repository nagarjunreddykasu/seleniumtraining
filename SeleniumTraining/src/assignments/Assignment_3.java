/*
1.	Write a program to declare two instance variables of type 'String' and assign the values of local variables to those two instance variables using 'this' keyword.
2.	Write a program to define instance methods with return types int, boolean, String and call those methods, store the returned values in corresponding variables in main method & print the returned values.
3.	Write a program to define static methods with return types int, boolean, String and call those methods, store the returned values in corresponding variables in main method & print the returned values.
4.	Write a program to define one instance method with return type boolean & one static method with return type String and call those methods, store the returned values in corresponding variables in main method & print the returned values.
5.	Write a program to define one instance method & one static method by returning local variable and print the returned values in console.
6.	Write a program to define one instance method by returning instance variable using this keyword and print the returned value in console.
7.	Write programs for the following scenarios: 
	a.	Create a class (ex: Test1) with two instance variables of type 'String' and one instance method.
	b.	Create another class(ex: Test2) with one instance method by returning above class (Test1) object and call the instance members using returned object in main method.
8.	Write programs for the following scenarios: 
	a.	Create a class (ex: Test3) with two instance variables of type 'int' and one instance method with return type 'String'.
	b.	Create another class(ex: Test4) with one static method by returning above class (Test3) object and call the instance members using returned object in main method.
9.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
	a.	Create a class (ex: Test5) with two instance variables of type 'String' and one instance method.
	b.	Create another class(ex: Test6) with one instance method by passing above class (Test5) object as parameter and call the instance members of 'Test5' class in instance method.
10.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
	a.	Create a class (ex: Test7) with two instance variables of type 'String' and one instance method with return type 'boolean'.
	b.	Create another class(ex: Test8) with one static method by passing above class (Test7) object as parameter and call the instance members of 'Test7' class in instance method.
