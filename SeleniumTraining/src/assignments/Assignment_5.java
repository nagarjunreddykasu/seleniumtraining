/*Inheritance:
--------------
1.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent1) with two instance methods
b. Create a child class (ex:Child1) by inheriting above Parent class and define other two instance methods and then call all the parent and child class methods in main method

2.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent2) with two instance variables and two instance methods
b. Create a child class (ex:Child2) by inheriting above Parent class and define other two instance methods and then call all the parent and child class members in main method

3.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent3) with two static variables and one instance & static methods
b. Create a child class (ex:Child3) by inheriting above Parent class and define other two instance methods with return type String and then call all the parent and child class members in main method

4.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent4) with two instance variables and one instance & static methods
b. Create a child class (ex:Child4) by inheriting above Parent class and define other one instance method with return type boolean and then call all the possible members using parent class object in main method

5.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent1) with one instance & one static variable and one instance & one static method
b. Create another class (ex:Parent2) by inheriting above Parent class (Parent1) and define other one instance method with return type boolean & one static method
c. Create a child class (ex:Child1) by inheriting above Parent class(Parent2) and define other two instance methods and then call all the parent & child class members in main method.

6.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent1) with one instance & one static variable of type String and one instance & one static method with return type String
b. Create another class (ex:Parent2) by inheriting above Parent class (Parent1) and define other one instance method with return type int & one static method with return type String
c. Create a child class (ex:Child1) by inheriting above Parent class(Parent2) and define other two instance variables & two static methods and then call all the parent & child class members in main method.

7.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent1) with two instance methods with return type String
b. Create another class (ex:Parent2) by inheriting above Parent class (Parent1) and define other two instance method with return type int & one static method with return type String
c. Create a child class (ex:Child1) by inheriting above Parent class(Parent2) and define other two instance variables & two instance methods and then call only the above two parent class members using parent2 class object in main method.

8.	Write programs for the following scenarios:
a. Create a parent class (ex:Parent1) with two instance methods
b. Create a child class (ex:Child1) by inheriting above Parent class and define the same two instance methods of above parent class and call the parent & child class methods in main method.
