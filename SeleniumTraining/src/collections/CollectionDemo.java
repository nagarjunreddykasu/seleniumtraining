/*

Collection:

Collections are growable in nature. i.e, we can increase or decrease based on our requirement.
Collections can hold both homogenious and heterogeneous data type elements
Collections can hold only objects but not primitives.
Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structures, so
predefine method support available for every requirement.

 			Collection(i)
 						
 List(i)															Set(i)
 
 
List(i)

ArrayList(c)	LinkedList(c) 	Vector(c)
								
								Stack(c)
								
								
ArrayList(c):
-------------
Heterogenious objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects.
Duplicate objects are allowed.
Insertion order is preserved. i.e, we can retrieve the objects in the same order which we inserted.
data structure is growable array.
We can retrieve the data from ArrayList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator.
