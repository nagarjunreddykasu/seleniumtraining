Collection:

Collections are grow-able in nature. i.e, we can increase or decrease based on our requirement.
Collections can hold both homogeneous and heterogeneous data type elements
Collections can hold only objects but not primitives.
Every collection class is implemented based on some standard data structures, so
predefine method support available for every requirement.

 			Collection(i)
 						
 List(i)															Set(i)
 
 
List(i)

ArrayList(c)	LinkedList(c) 	Vector(c)
								
								Stack(c)
								
								
ArrayList(c):
-------------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects.
Duplicate objects are allowed.
Insertion order is preserved. i.e, we can retrieve the objects in the same order which we inserted.
data structure is grow-able array.
We can retrieve the data from ArrayList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator.

LinkedList(c):
--------------
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects.
Duplicate objects are allowed.
Insertion order is preserved. i.e, we can retrieve the objects in the same order which we inserted.
data structure is double Linked list.
We can retrieve the data from LinkedList by using cursors: Iterator and ListIterator.


Vector(c):
-----------
Vector class is implemented in java 1.0 version
Heterogeneous objects are allowed (different types of data)
It is possible to insert NULL objects.
Duplicate objects are allowed.
Insertion order is preserved. i.e, we can retrieve the objects in the same order which we inserted.
data structure is resizable array.
We can retrieve the data from LinkedList by using cursors: Enumeration, Iterator and ListIterator.
